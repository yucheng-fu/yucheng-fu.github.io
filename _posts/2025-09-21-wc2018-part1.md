## Introduction 
This is part one of my analysis of the round of 16 match between France and Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. This match is especially memorable for me as football fan, because it was the first match between Lionel Mesi and Kylian Mbappe, signaling a change of guards between two football generations. It was also the first game of the knockout rounds and also the joint-highest scoring game of the whole tournament.

Benjamin Pavard also scored a spectacular goal in the 57th minute which would later be awarded the goal of the tournament. If you are unaware of the goal in question, have a look at the video [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov39iGAgEn4). 

This part of the analysis will give a brief introduction to event data in football, and then provide an analysis of the shots and expected goals (xG) in the match, tactics and lineups, and lastly possession patterns.

## What is event data in football?
Event data in football refers to detailed, timestamped records of every key action that occurs during a match between two teams. These events are logged with context such as time, location on the pitch ($$x$$ and $$y$$ position), players involved and outcomes.<d-cite key="statsbomb2025"></d-cite>

There are plenty of freely available collections of event data, such as Opta and Statsbomb. In this analysis, I will use the data provided by Statsbomb through their ``statsbombpy`` python API. 

## Heat map of event density
We first extract all events which have a physical location on the pitch, e.g. passes, blocks, clearences, shots, and dribbles. By extracting the $(x,y)$ coordinates for all events for France and Argentina in the match, we get an idea of where actions are taken on the pitch.

We then construct a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plot on top of the football pitch to better highlight areas of high and low event concentration and aid us in understanding the overall territorial dominance on the pitch.

France seems to have dominated the midfield with noticably darker areas in the centre of midfield. Argentina on the other hand have a higher concentration of actions on the right side of the pitch. 

Inspired by [this post](https://karun.in/blog/interactive-passing-networks.html) by Karun Singh, let us plot the average positions of the players in the starting 11.

    </div>

<div class="caption">

</div>
For France, we indeed see that Blaise Matuidi has dropped inwards from the wing and tucks into the left side of the midfield, forming a three-man midfield with Kante and Pogba. Even though their starting lineup is a 4-2-3-1 on paper, the data shows that they are mainly lining up in a 4-3-3. 

The event data for Argentina also shows that they have overloaded the right side, pushing up Pavon, Perez and Mercado on the right wing. Even though they line up in a 4-3-3, their average positions resemble something like a 2-4-4 formation. Very unusual! This could also explain why Matuidi was forced to drop further down in midfield.

## Goals and expected goals (xG)
The game between France and Argentina ended 4-3 in France's favour. Although Argentina narrowly eclipsed France's shot count with 10 attempts to France's 9 - with both sides with 4 on target, France were more clinical in front of goal. 

Of course not all shots are equally likely to result in a goal. That is where the expected goals (xG) metric comes in. The xG metric expresses the likelihood of a given shot resulting in a goal based on thousands of past shots with similar features,  such as distance, angle, location, and defensive pressure.</d-cite></d-cite><d-cite key="hudl2025"></d-cite> For instance, Opta's xG model is trained on nealy one million shots from 40 different competitions between 2018-2022.</d-cite></d-cite><d-cite key="opta2023"></d-cite> As a result, xG provides a more meaningful reflection of the quality of chances created than raw shot numbers alone. 

Let us first have a look at France's shots and goals: 
### France's shots and goals

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
  <div style="max-width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
    {% include figure.liquid

</div>
We observe that the majority of France's shots are taken within from a central position within the penalty box, indicating that their attacking approach in the final third of the pitch consistently led to chances in favourable positions. Out of seven shots inside the box, three of them lead to goals, one of which was a penalty scored by Mbappé.

One of the few shots from outside the box was Pavard's half volley with an xG of just 0.0242 based on StatBomb's computations, highlighting just how unlikely it is to score a long-range shot. (This is a goal we will dive deeper into in the next part of the analysis). At the other end of the spectrum, Mbappé's penalty has an enormous xG of 0.7835, meaning a conversion rate of around 78% from this type of shot. When you compare it to the two other goals with more modest xG values of 0.1178 and 0.2210, it clearly highlights the just how decisive and high-quality a penalty kick can be.

</div>
Argentina also has a lot of shots within the penalty box, although from considerably worse positions. Out of 8 shots from within the penalty box, they managed to score two. Interestingly, among their shots outside the box, three were taken from almost the same position on the left. They also managed to score an outside-the-box goal with a simiarly low xG value, which was scored by Di Maria.  

## Possession patterns
Non-linear relationships in football are everywhere because the game is dynamic, and constrained by spatial and tactical rules. To analyse possession patterns and tactics of France and Argentina, we turn our heads to Gaussian mixture models (GMM) due to their ability to capture the underlying structure in complex, multi-dimensional data.

As the name suggests, Gaussian mixture models are constructed by using a mixture of Gaussian distributions, each weighted with a mixture weight $\pi_k$:

$$
p(\bf{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k \, \mathcal{N}(\bf{x} | \bf{\mu}_k, \bf{\Sigma}_k)
$$

where $K$ is the number of mixture components determined from data.

We fit a GMM for both France and Argentina using possession data. We define this as events that have an end location, which includes carries, passes and successful dribbles. The number of components is determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):

$$
\text{BIC} = k \ln (n) - 2 \ln{(\hat{L})}
$$

where $$\hat{L} = \max p(\mathbf{x} \mid \theta)$$ is the maximised value of the likelihood function with parameters $$\mathbf{\theta} = \{\mathbf{\pi}, \mathbf{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma}\}$$.

### France's possession patterns
We fit the GMM on our possesssion data and visualise the shape and size of each Gaussian component projected down onto a 2D football pitch. 
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    %}
  </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    GMM components fitted on France's possession data visualised on football pitch. Using BIC, we get $K=10$ different mixture components.
</div>
We can immediately observe that there are two very distinct clusters in the fullback positions on either side of the pitch. This suggests that much of France's possession goes through the wing. Furthermore, there are two prominent clusters in the midfield, coinciding with the average positions of the three midfielders Kante, Matuidi, and Pogba.

Notice the cluster in France's goal keeping area and centreback positions, suggesting a strategy of building up play from the back. In the modern game, it is no longer viable to just let the goalkeeper hoof the ball from the penalty box and hope a teammate wins the ball. 

We can also evaluate the probability density function (PDF) of the GMM on the football pitch to quantify how likely the ball ends up at any given area of the pitch during France's possession.

</div>
The probability densities of our GMM supports our previous observations: much of the possession comes through on the wings and centre of the midfield. Interestingly, a large portion of the possession is also concentrated around the area of the left centreback Umtiti, which indicates he plays a large role in building up play from the back. 

### Argentina's possession patterns
<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

In Argentina's case, the possession is heavily right-skewed. Much of the possession goes throug the right wing, where we previously saw an overload of four players, including Messi. 

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
  <div style="max-width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
    {% include figure.liquid 
        loading="eager" 
        path="football_analytics/figures/analysis-01/argentina_gmm_pdf.png" 
        class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"

<div class="caption">

</div>

Unlike France, Argentina does not have much possession attributed to the central midfield or centrebacks. In fact, the PDF shows that much of the possession is concentrated on the right side of the pitch. It seems that Argentina has had an overreliance on progressing the ball from the right side of the pitch because they were dominated in midfield. 

### Sampling possession events from GMM
One neat advantage of using GMMs instead of KDEs is that we can generate samples from our fitted GMM. In this case, we can In this case, we can sample possession events to analyse where France's next events *could* happen given their possession pattern in the match. 

This could be useful for opposing football analysts to understand how France plays and keeps possession.
